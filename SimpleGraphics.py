#  A simple graphics wrapper on top of tkinter
#  Copyright (C) 2013, 2014, 2015 Ben Stephenson
#
#  This wrapper is designed to require as little effort as possible from the
#  programmer making use of it.  Importing the library opens a graphics
#  window, and ensures that the application enters the Tcl/Tk main loop 
#  before the program terminates.  By default, updates are performed to the
#  canvas every time a primitive is drawn or the closed status of the 
#  application is checked.
#
#  The programmer using this wrapper should never call any of the functions
#  that begin with double underscore directly.  
#
#  Known Bugs: 
#    * It appears that different operating systems number the buttons
#      differently.  While button 1 always seems to be the left button, 
#      whether button 2 is the right button or the middle button seems to vary.
#
#    * Changing to a new font using setFont and then displaying text can
#      result in previously drawn text being updated to use the new font.
#      The exact circumstances that cause this to occur are currently unclear.
#
#    * Resize seems to fail on occasion.  The program that displays 
#      all of the colors has demonstrated this behaviour occasionally.
#
#  Please report bugs to ben.stephenson@ucalgary.ca

#  Revision History:
#    v1.0.0 -- Publicly released January 23, 2014
#    v1.0.1 -- Publicly released February 7, 2014
#              Added close function to allow the programmer to close the window
#              Added the setWindowTitle function to allow the programmer
#                to change the contents of the window's title bar
#              SimpleGraphics now maintains a list of image references
#                so that images don't disappear when the function ends
#              setWidth() now impacts polygons, blobs, arcs and pie slices
#    v1.0.2 -- Publicly released February 16, 2014
#              Fixed a bug in the close function where it could attempt
#                to invoke a method on a None object without successfully
#                catching the exception.
#    v1.0.3 -- Publicly released August 19, 2014
#              Added savePPM and saveGIF functions for images
#    v1.0.4 -- Publicly released September 26, 2014
#              Added a try/except around the import for unregister so a
#              better error message is displayed when SimpleGraphics.py is
#              run with Python 2.x.y
#    v1.0.5 -- Publicly released November 4, 2014
#              Adjusted the implementation of getPixel to adapt to
#              PhotoImage.get() returning a string in most versions, but a
#              tuple in Python 3.4.x for Windows.
#    v1.0.6 -- Fixed several bugs related to drawing rectangles with widths 
#              and/or heights of 1.
#              Added a name to each font and improved the handling of font
#              modifiers.  This may have fixed the problem with setFont.
#              Added the fontList function
#              Added the keys set
